    "\n",
    "Think of required parameters as the must-have details you need to give when using an API—like filling out a form where some fields are marked with a star (*). If you leave these out, the API won’t work and will let you know something’s missing.\n",

    "### **Optional Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional parameters are like the extra fields on a form that you can fill in if you want. They aren’t necessary, but adding them can help the API do more or give you better results. If you skip them, the API still works, just with its default settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you’re using a weather API, a required parameter might be the city name (like \"Lahore\"), while an optional parameter could be the units of measurement (like \"Celsius\" or \"Fahrenheit\"). If you don’t specify the units, the API will just use its default setting, which might be Fahrenheit."
